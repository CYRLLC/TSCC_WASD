## SDL Switch 2 protocol reference and adaptation

The NS2 Pro USB command sequence and HD-rumble encoding are adapted from SDL's
`SDL_hidapi_switch2.c`; its input, IMU and calibration formats are used by the C# parser. The adapted portions
retain SDL's zlib license and are marked as altered. See [full notice](licenses/SDL.txt).
No SDL or libusb binary is bundled; the transport uses Windows WinUSB and HID APIs.

## DualShock 4, DualSense and Switch Pro report layouts

The DualShock 4 / DualSense and original Switch Pro report formats used by the experimental
readers were written from public documentation (Sony controller reverse-engineering notes and
dekuNukem's Nintendo_Switch_Reverse_Engineering) and cross-checked against SDL's hidapi drivers
(zlib). No SDL source was copied for them.

## .NET runtime (distributed inside TSCC_WASD.exe)

Release builds are self-contained: the .NET 10 runtime and WPF/Windows Forms libraries are
bundled into `TSCC_WASD.exe`. They are MIT licensed by the .NET Foundation and contributors:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime, https://github.com/dotnet/wpf and
https://github.com/dotnet/winforms (each repository's LICENSE.TXT and THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.TXT).

## Driver installers (distributed unmodified in `drivers/`)

The release ZIP includes the official, Authenticode-signed installers exactly as published by
Nefarius Software Solutions e.U. TSCC_WASD does not modify them; it only starts them when the
user agrees, after checking the SHA-256 pinned in `TSCC_WASD.Core/drivers.json`.

- **ViGEmBus 1.22.0** (`ViGEmBus_1.22.0_x64_x86_arm64.exe`), BSD-3-Clause:
  https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus. See [licenses/ViGEmBus.txt](licenses/ViGEmBus.txt).
  ViGEmBus is end-of-life upstream: https://docs.nefarius.at/projects/ViGEm/End-of-Life/
- **HidHide 1.5.230** (`HidHide_1.5.230_x64.exe`), MIT: https://github.com/nefarius/HidHide.
  See [licenses/HidHide.txt](licenses/HidHide.txt). While mapping, TSCC_WASD runs the installed
  `HidHideCLI.exe` as a separate process to change and later restore its configuration; no
  HidHide code is linked into TSCC_WASD.

## Not bundled

- Windows XInput API is supplied by Windows.
- Steam is not bundled or linked. TSCC_WASD only starts the user's installed `steam.exe`
  (with `-shutdown`, then normally) when the user asks it to restart Steam.

## Development-only packages

Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk, xUnit and its Visual Studio runner are test dependencies;
they are not included in the application ZIP. Refer to their NuGet metadata and
upstream repositories for notices. Each project's packages.lock.json records
versions and integrity hashes.

PlayStation, DualShock, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Steam and reWASD names belong to their respective owners.
TSCC_WASD is an independent project and does not imply endorsement.
