# Validation record

## Local automated validation — 2026-09-08

Environment: Windows 11 x64 (build 26100), .NET SDK 8.0.416.
Release build: zero warnings/errors. Automated tests: **56 passed, 0 failed**.
Release build and driver-independent tests are exercised locally; GitHub-hosted
workflows need their first run after the repository is pushed.

Coverage includes all signed-short axis values, endpoints/inversion/dead zones,
malformed/empty/legacy profiles, backups, invalid saves, isolated session settings,
disconnect neutralization, driver errors, callback failures and disposal.
WPF editor commands/bindings are exercised on an STA thread and rendered for review.
The inbox XInput API is loaded; this alone does not prove device/game compatibility.

NuGet transitive audit after removing SharpDX reports no known vulnerable packages
from the configured NuGet source. This is a point-in-time package audit, not a
security assessment of Windows or the external ViGEmBus driver.

Optional real-driver smoke check also passed against the packaged DLLs:
virtual DS4 connection, neutral report submission, disconnection and disposal.
Run it explicitly on a machine with ViGEmBus installed:

```powershell
pwsh -File scripts/smoke-driver.ps1 -AppDirectory <extracted-app-directory>
```

This creates a short-lived neutral virtual controller. It does not test physical
button input, HidHide setup, game recognition or long-running stability.

## Manual hardware validation

### 0.4.0 — 2026-10-09

Same machine: Windows 11 26100, .NET 10.0.401 SDK, NS2 Pro on USB (Steam running, shared HID).

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Build/test/package on .NET 10 (`scripts/package.ps1`, warnings as errors) | Passed, 93 tests |
| Virtual DS4 raw report read back through its HID interface: Cross, PS + touchpad bits, gyro, accel, touch "lifted" flags | Passed (exact values) |
| ViGEm DS4 output report layout for rumble (`[1]` flags, `[4]` small, `[5]` large) | Passed, probed with a HID write |
| NS2 Pro IMU in shared mode: 476/476 samples, gyro ≈ 0 at rest, accel magnitude ≈ 1 g in DS4 units | Passed |
| NS2 Pro rumble packet written | Sent; felt-vibration confirmation pending |
| Xbox Guide via XInputGetStateEx, Xbox rumble | Pending (controller was off) |
| Wired Xbox hiding | Pending (no wired controller); enumeration finds no false positives |
| Start with Windows / tray / automatic Steam handling on a real sign-in | Pending |
| Gyro direction in a motion-aware game | Pending |

### Auto-detect + automatic HidHide — 0.3.0, 2026-10-09

Windows 11 26100, HidHide 1.2.98, Steam and DS4Windows running, Bluetooth Xbox
Wireless Controller (`045E:0B13`) and NS2 Pro USB connected at the same time.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Auto mapping start: virtual DS4 created, 2 physical HID interfaces hidden, cloak on | Passed |
| Non-allowlisted process during mapping: XInput slot 0 returns not-connected | Passed |
| Stop / window close: cloak, hidden list and app list restored to prior state | Passed |
| DS4Windows does not re-wrap the virtual DS4 into an extra XInput pad | Passed |
| Yakuza 0 Director's Cut, Steam started before mapping | Prompts alternated Xbox/PS (Steam held the controller); elevated device restart was vetoed |
| Same game, Steam Input disabled | Stable Xbox prompts (game takes PS prompts from Steam Input) |
| Same game, Steam restarted after mapping started, Steam Input default | **Passed, user-confirmed PS prompts** |

### NS2 Pro USB — 0.2.0

Steam remained running at the user's request. Shared HID mode received valid
64-byte report 0x05 packets from the attached NS2 Pro and ran for 30 seconds,
sampling 1,916 valid states while submitting them to a temporary virtual DS4.
No button presses were observed during that automated capture. In a subsequent
manual test on 2026-09-08, the user confirmed live input in TSCC_WASD and successful
input through the virtual PS4 in Steam's device test. **The basic NS2 Pro USB →
shared HID → virtual DS4 path is user-confirmed working.** This does not certify
every button, full stick travel or in-game compatibility.
USB calibration access returned access denied while Steam held the interface;
the fallback used nominal calibration.
Standalone initialization was subsequently tested below. Physical hot-plug remains pending.

### NS2 Pro diagnosis — 2026-09-11

Tested the running app's packaged 0.2.0 DLLs, with the WPF mapping stopped.
HidHide was initially running with cloaking OFF, no hidden devices, and only its
CLI allowlisted. DS4Windows was also running; its log showed controller search,
but no evidence of an additional mapping was observed during these tests.
The saved TSCC_WASD profile used XInput (`inputType: 0`), not NS2 Pro USB.

| Configuration | Duration | Fresh-state polls | Missing polls after first input |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Steam running, hiding off, input only | 30 s | 1,918 / 1,918 | 0 |
| Steam normally exited, hiding off, input only | 15 s | 958 / 959 | 0 |
| Steam exited, NS2 Pro hidden, diagnostic process allowlisted, virtual DS4 output | 30 s | 1,915 / 1,915 | 0 |

Steam-running input used shared HID/nominal calibration. Both Steam-exited runs
successfully performed USB initialization and loaded factory/user calibration.
The initial unavailable poll in the second run occurred before first input.
These counts are polling observations, not unique USB packets. The reader regards
reports as fresh for 250 ms; this test does not measure sub-250 ms packet gaps.

A separate Windows PowerShell process, absent from the HidHide allowlist, could
open the physical HID before hiding. During hiding it received access denied
(Win32 error 5) for the physical HID but could open the virtual DS4 HID. This
verifies device isolation and virtual-device accessibility, not game behavior.
The mapping run submitted states without reported errors; no button presses
were observed, so individual controls and end-to-end input remain unverified.

The physical controller was not unplugged between runs: standalone cold-plug
initialization is still unverified. The reported game is Zenless Zone Zero;
the game issue was not reproduced in this session. Temporary HidHide changes
were reverted and Steam was relaunched after the comparison.

### Other devices and scenarios

Record controller model, transport, OS, driver versions, game version and observed
result for each test. Automated fake-device tests cannot replace these checks.
